# CAC-Analysis-by-python
Here I performed Customer Acquisition Cost Analysis for a marketing Campaign of E-Commerce Company

Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) is a critical metric for businesses that want to assess the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of their marketing efforts. It represents the average cost incurred by a company to acquire a single customer. Analyzing CAC helps businesses optimize their marketing strategies, allocate resources effectively, and improve their return on investment (ROI).

The dataset includes the following columns:

Customer_ID: Unique identifiers for customers.
Marketing_Channel: The marketing channel through which customers were acquired (e.g., Email Marketing, Online Ads, Social Media).
Marketing_Spend: The amount of money spent on marketing for each channel.
New_Customers: The number of new customers acquired through each marketing channel.

Your task is to:

CAC values for each marketing channel.
Data visualizations illustrating CAC by marketing channel.
Identification of the most cost-effective marketing channel for customer acquisition.
Insights and recommendations for optimizing marketing strategies based on CAC analysis.
